	description = "Teshari are a small avian race, hailing from the poles of Qerrbalak, outside of the control of the Skrell. \
	As a pack race Teshari can vary wildly from pack to pack, but packs typically consist of individuals with similar or \
	complementary mindsets. Teshari never developed space flight themselves, but due to their small size, exceptional hearing, \
	and good dark vision the Skrell brought them aboard their ships to serve as engineers for the cramped maintenance tunnels of \
	their vessels. In modern times Tesharii can be seen serving as anything from simple engineers to scientists and doctors."
